2) Download the chromedriver (check the latest version here -> https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE)
3) Perform the following steps:

```
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip 
mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

docker run -rm -ti ancvrestaurantscraper:latest "-c <city>"

docker run -it ancvrestaurantscraper_output:latest /bin/bash
```
